## What is a pointer?
C operates at a relatively low level. By low level, we mean that it's a language that makes it fairly easy to access the operating system and the computer hardware.
On the plus side, that means that you can optimize your programs to make them very fast and very efficient.
On the downside, it means that C does not protect your programs from making silly or even dangerous mistakes.

A pointer is a variable that refers to (or points to) an address in your computer memory. Think of the computer memory as a long series of locations where bits of data are stored, and the location or `position in memory hwere some piece of data is stored is an address.
So if we want to find a specific piece of data in memory, we need to find the address where it is stored. That is what the pointer does.
